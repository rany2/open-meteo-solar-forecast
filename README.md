## Python API fetching Solarpanels forecast information.

## About

With this python library you can request data from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)
and see what your solar panels may produce in the coming days.

## Installation

```bash
pip install open-meteo-solar-forecast
```

## Data

This library returns a lot of different data, based on the API:

### Energy

- Total Estimated Energy Production - today/tomorrow (kWh)
- Estimated Energy Production - This Hour (kWh)
- Estimated Energy Production - Next Hour (kWh)
- Estimated Energy Production - Remaining today (kWh)

### Power

- Highest Power Peak Time - Today (datetime)
- Highest Power Peak Time - Tomorrow (datetime)
- Estimated Power Production - Now (W)
- Estimated Power Production - Next Hour (W)
- Estimated Power Production - In +6 Hours (W)
- Estimated Power Production - In +12 Hours (W)
- Estimated Power Production - In +24 Hours (W)

### API Info

- Timezone
- Rate limit
- Account type
- Rate remaining

### Validation

- API key (bool)
- Plane (bool)

## Example

```python
import asyncio

from open_meteo_solar_forecast import OpenMeteoSolarForecast


async def main() -> None:
    """Show example on how to use the library."""
    async with OpenMeteoSolarForecast(
        latitude=52.16,
        longitude=4.47,
        declination=20,
        azimuth=10,
        kwp=2.160,
    ) as forecast:
        estimate = await forecast.estimate()
        print(estimate)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

| Parameter | value type | Description |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `base_url` | `str` | The base URL of the API (optional) |
| `api_key` | `str` | Your API key (optional) |
| `declination` | `int` | The tilt of the solar panels (required) |
| `azimuth` | `int` | The direction the solar panels are facing (required) |
| `kwp` | `float` | The size of the solar panels in kWp (required) |
